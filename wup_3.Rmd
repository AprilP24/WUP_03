```

```{r include=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
require(tigerstats)
davisdata <- read.csv(file="UCDavis.csv")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
davisdata <- davisdata %>%
mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor))
```

## Our Goal is to answer this question Is there a difference between the alcohol consumed between the row
## you choose to sit in??

## Now with ggplot - first select the basic data

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(davisdata, aes(x = Seat, y = alcohol)) +
  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE, outlier.color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Notched Box Plot by Seat") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```
